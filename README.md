Welcome to our Hospital Management System built with Flutter and the MERN stack!

Our system is designed to efficiently manage hospital operations and provide healthcare professionals with the tools they need to deliver top-quality care. We offer a user-friendly interface and an easy-to-use mobile app, all backed by a robust API that follows RESTful principles.

To get started, simply log in or register with your credentials. Once logged in, you can manage patients, doctors, appointments, medical history, medical reports, and medical professionals. With our system, you can quickly view and update patient information, schedule and manage appointments, and access medical reports with ease.

Our app provides seamless navigation and intuitive user experience, making it simple to manage complex hospital operations with just a few taps. We use JWT tokens for authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access privileged information.

We hope that our Hospital Management System will improve your hospital's efficiency and help deliver exceptional care to your patients.
